# scikitlearn-digits-test
This is a simple practice of scikit learn.
With this program you can train an AI that can predict the digit from an image of the handwritten digit.

# Training
For training, create a folder called `dataset` inside the root folder, and inside create a folder for each digit you want to predict, for example:
```
dataset
  - 0
    - image1.png
    - image2.png
   
  - 1
    -image1.png
    -image2.png
    
  -etc
```

For my practice I used this dataset that its already in the required format. https://www.kaggle.com/sagyamthapa/handwritten-math-symbols

# Usage

When you have a trained model you can use it by running the script `play.py`, you need to create some image of your input.
